** Connecting Angular Frontend to Spring Boot Restful Services **

	- Angular Observables
		- Asynchronous, wait for the response

		- CORS policy : 2 web servers are calling each others.
		- spring boot fix
		- response => Arrow function
		- HTML form
			-  (ngModelChange)
		- data picker from angular material
		- Restfulbackend : return location after POST with URI uri = ServletUriComponentsBuilder.
		- REST best practices : 
		- When a resource is created do not send 200 code
		- Never send a server error 500 when there is something wrong
		- Prefer /users/1 to /user/1
		- Use nouns for resources. Exception to /search
		- Github :  PUT /gists/{id}/star
					DELETE /gists/{id/star
